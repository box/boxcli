## `box events`

Get events

```
USAGE
  $ box events

OPTIONS
  -e, --enterprise
      Get enterprise events

  -h, --help
      Show CLI help

  -q, --quiet
      Suppress any non-error output to stderr

  -s, --save
      Save report to default reports folder on disk

  -t, --token=token
      Provide a token to perform this call

  -v, --verbose
      Show verbose output, which can be helpful for debugging

  -y, --yes
      Automatically respond yes to all confirmation prompts

  --as-user=as-user
      Provide an ID for a user

  --bulk-file-path=bulk-file-path
      File path to bulk .csv or .json objects

  --created-after=created-after
      Return enterprise events that occurred after a time. Use a timestamp or shorthand syntax 0t, like 5w for 5 weeks. If 
      not used, defaults to 5 days before the end date

  --created-before=created-before
      Return enterprise events that occurred before a time. Use a timestamp or shorthand syntax 0t, like 5w for 5 weeks. 
      If not used, defaults to now

  --csv
      Output formatted CSV

  --event-types=event-types
      Return enterprise events filtered by event types. Format using a comma delimited list: 
      NEW_USER,DELETE_USER,EDIT_USER

  --fields=fields
      Comma separated list of fields to show

  --json
      Output formatted JSON

  --limit=limit
      The maximum number of items to return

  --no-color
      Turn off colors for logging

  --save-to-file-path=save-to-file-path
      Override default file path to save report

  --stream-position=stream-position
      The location in the event stream from which you want to start receiving events

  --stream-type=admin_logs|admin_logs_streaming
      Stream type admin_logs or admin_logs_streaming.
      Unless specified `admin_logs` stream type is used.

      The emphasis for `admin_logs` stream is on completeness over latency, which means that Box will deliver admin events 
      in chronological order and without duplicates, but with higher latency. You can specify start and end time/dates.

      The emphasis for `admin_logs_streaming` feed is on low latency rather than chronological accuracy, which means that 
      Box may return events more than once and out of chronological order. Events are returned via the API around 12 
      seconds after they are processed by Box (the 12 seconds buffer ensures that new events are not written after your 
      cursor position). Only two weeks of events are available via this feed, and you cannot set start and end time/dates.

ALIASES
