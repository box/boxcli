The Box CLI is a user-friendly command line tool which allows both technical and non-technical users to leverage the Box API to perform routine or bulk actions. There is no need to write any code, as these actions are executed through a [set of commands](#command-topics).

Among other features, Box CLI includes the following functionality:
* Bulk actions - A csv file can be used to execute commands in bulk, and each row of the spreadsheet is treated as an individual API call.
* As-User header - Act on behalf of another user.
* Search API - Search for files and folders in your Box Enterprise account.

## Getting Started

The most convenient way to get start with Box CLI is to follow [Box CLI with OAuth 2.0 guide][oauth-guide]. You will be guided how to configure Box application and install CLI on your machine.

### CLI Installation
Installers are available for Windows and macOS. However, the raw source-code is available if you would like to build the CLI in other environments.

#### Windows & macOS Installers
To install the latest CLI on your machine, download the latest `.exe` for Windows or `.pkg` for macOS for the [latest release](https://github.com/box/boxcli/releases).

#### Linux & Node install
Additionally, the CLI can be installed as a Node package on any platform, including Linux. For this to work, you will need to have [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.

```bash
npm install --global @box/cli
```

### CLI and Server Authentication with JWT

Alternatively, to get started with the Box CLI, [download and install](#CLI-Installation) CLI, set up a Box application using Server Authentication with JWT and
download the JSON configuration file from the Configuration page of your app in the
[Box Developer Console][dev-console] following [JWT CLI Guide][jwt-guide].  Then, set up the CLI by pointing it to your configuration file:

```sh-session
$ box configure:environments:add PATH_TO_CONFIG_FILE
Successfully added CLI environment "default"
```

If you manually generated your own private key to use with JWT authentication, you will need to point the CLI to the
location of your private key file:

```sh-session
$ box configure:environments:add PATH_TO_CONFIG_FILE --private-key-path PATH_TO_PRIVATE_KEY --name ManualKey
Successfully added CLI environment "ManualKey"
```

Box API, you can post to the [Box Developer Forum](https://community.box.com/t5/Developer-Forum/bd-p/DeveloperForum).


## Versions

We use a modified version of [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) for all changes. See [version strategy](VERSIONS.md) for details which is effective from 30 July 2022.

### Supported Version

Only the current MAJOR version of SDK is supported. New features, functionality, bug fixes, and security updates will only be added to the current MAJOR version.

A current release is on the leading edge of our SDK development, and is intended for customers who are in active development and want the latest and greatest features.  Instead of stating a release date for a new feature, we set a fixed minor or patch release cadence of maximum 2-3 months (while we may release more often). At the same time, there is no schedule for major or breaking release. Instead, we will communicate one quarter in advance the upcoming breaking change to allow customers to plan for the upgrade. We always recommend that all users run the latest available minor release for whatever major version is in use. We highly recommend upgrading to the latest SDK major release at the earliest convenient time and before the EOL date.

### Version schedule

| Version | Supported Environments  | State     | First Release | EOL/Terminated |

| 3       | Node.js >= 12 and <= 14 | Supported | 01 Feb 2022   | TBD            |
| 2       |                         | EOL       | 14 Dec 2018   | 01 Feb 2022    |
| 1       |                         | EOL       | 01 Nov 2017   | 14 Dec 2018    |
