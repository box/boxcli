Getting Started
---------------

To get started with the Box CLI, first set up a Box application using Server Authentication with JWT and
download the JSON configuration file from the Configuration page of your app in the
[Box Developer Console][dev-console].  Then, set up the CLI by pointing it to your configuration file:

```sh-session
$ box configure:environments:add PATH_TO_CONFIG_FILE
Successfully added CLI environment "default"
```

If you manually generated your own private key to use with JWT authentication, you will need to point the CLI to the
location of your private key file:

```sh-session
$ box configure:environments:add PATH_TO_CONFIG_FILE --private-key-path PATH_TO_PRIVATE_KEY --name ManualKey
Successfully added CLI environment "ManualKey"
```

[dev-console]: https://app.box.com/developers/console
