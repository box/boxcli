## Setup Pre-Requisites
1. Clone this github repo or download files from the `/examples` directory
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/box/boxcli.git
   ```
2. Install PowerShell or .Net core.
   > If you encounter issues make sure you install both dotnet core and PowerShell
	1. For MacOS & Linux, Install the latest version of [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell?view=powershell-7.2).
	2. For Windows, Install the latest version of [dotnet core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).

3. Test PowerShell by running the `pwsh` command in your terminal.
    ```bash
    pwsh
    ```

4. Create an OAuth Application following the [CLI Setup Quick Start][oauth-guide].

## 1. Script Parameters
1. Set the [folderID][folderID-param] you want the script to scan for metadata details.
2. Optional: To run the script as another user, set [userId][UserId-param] parameter.


## 2. Run the script

Change the directory to the folder containing the script. In this example, it is the `Metadata Extraction` folder.
```pwsh
rvb@lab:~/box-cli/examples/Metadata Extraction$ pwsh
PowerShell 7.2.4
Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation.

https://aka.ms/powershell
Type 'help' to get help.

PS /home/rvb/box-cli/examples/Metadata Extraction>
```

Run the script:
```pwsh
./Metadata-extraction.ps1 -folderId 173961139760 -userId 20718545815
```
If you don't specify parameters, the script will prompt you to enter it.

When the script run is completed, you will see the following
output or a similar one.

```
