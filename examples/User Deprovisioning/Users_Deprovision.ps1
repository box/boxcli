#APP SETUP
#README: This powershell script will use the Box CLI to deprovision a list of users by first checking if the user has content, transfering user content to another user (default: no), then deleting that user. 

#APPLICATION ACCESS LEVEL (FOR JWT APPS): App + Enterprise Access
#APPLICATION SCOPES: Read & Write all folders stored in Box, Manage users, & Make API calls using the as-user header

#Set Employee List CSV Path

#Transfer user content before deletion - "Y" or "N"
