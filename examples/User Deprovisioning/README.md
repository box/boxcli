# Deprovision & Delete Users Automation
This Box CLI script deprovision a list of users by first transfering user content to another user's root folder under "Employee Archive" before deleting that user.

> For every user, script makes 7 API calls to archive their content and delete the account.

## Configure the script
### Update the list of employees for deletion

The header row should look like the below:

   ```bash
   name, email
   ```

   where:
   
   * `name` is the name of the user in Box. 
   * `email` is the primary email address of the user in Box.

For example, update the [Employees_to_delete.csv](/examples/User%20Deprovisioning/Employees_to_delete.csv) with the following data:

   ```bash
   Managed,User 1,ManagedUser1@test.com,manageduser1
   Managed,User 2,ManagedUser2@test.com,manageduser2
   Managed,User 3,ManagedUser3@test.com,manageduser3
   ```

### List of parameters

   |`Parameter`| `Description`| `Required` | `Default Value` |
   |-----------|--------------|------------|-----------------|
   |`EmployeeList`|  Path to Employee List CSV with employees to be deleted. | Yes | - |
   |`SkipTransferContent`| Set this flag to skip transfer of user content before deletion when running the script. Otherwise user's content will be transferred. | No | `False` |
   |`NewFilesOwnerID`|  The ID of the user to transfer files to before deleting the user. If not specified, the script will prompt to input in the interactive mode, or use the current authenticated user ID to receive the content.| No | If not specified, the script will prompt to input in the interactive mode, or use the current authenticated user ID. |
   |`EmployeeArchiveFolderName`|The name of a folder, where users' content will be moved to if `SkipTransferContent` is set to `False`. If a folder with this name already exists in the user's `NewFilesOwnerID` root folder, it will be used. Otherwise, a new one will be created.|Yes|`Employee Archive`|
   |`DryRun`|A flag that determines the script should be run in a mode, where no delete/create/update calls will be made, only read ones. |No|`False`|


### Define script parameters

You can the following options to pass parameters.

* Use hardcoded value in script.

    To use this option, update all required parameters listed in the [script parameters section][parameters] before running.

* Run script with parameters.

  You can specify parameters while providing the command. For example:

     ```bash
      PS > ./Users_Deprovision.ps1 -EmployeeList ./Employees_to_delete.csv `
      -NewFilesOwnerID  123456789
      -EmployeeArchiveFolderName "Employee Archive"
     ```

  or

     ```bash
      PS > ./Users_Deprovision.ps1 -EmployeeList ./Employees_to_delete.csv `
      -SkipTransferContent
     ```

  If you don't specify parameters, the script will prompt you to enter it.

     ```bash
      PS > ./Users_Deprovision.ps1
      Please enter the path to the employee list CSV file:
      ./Employees_to_delete.csv
      Please specify the user ID of the user who will own the files of the users being deprovisioned.
      Press Enter if you want to use the current user as the new owner.
      User ID: 1234567689
      Starting User Deprovisioning script...
     ```

## Run the script
Now all you need to do is run the script. Change the directory to the folder containing the script. In this example, it is the `User Deprovisioning` folder.

```bash
rvb@lab:~/box-cli/examples/User Deprovisioning$ pwsh
PowerShell 7.2.4
Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation.

https://aka.ms/powershell
Type 'help' to get help.

PS /home/rvb/box-cli/examples/User Deprovisioning>
```

Run the script:

```bash
./Users_Deprovision.ps1
```

When all parameters are defined, you will see following output to confirm the script started:

```bash
PS /home/rvb/box-cli/examples/User Deprovisioning> ./Users_Deprovision.ps1
Starting User Deprovisioning script...
```

## Logging
Logs are stored in a `logs` folder located in the main folder. You have access to these log files:

* `Users_Deprovision_all.txt` that contains all log entries.
* `Users_Deprovision_errors.txt` that contains only errors.
