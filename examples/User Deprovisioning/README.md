# Deprovision & Delete Users Automation
This Box CLI script deprovision a list of users by first transfering user content to another user's root folder under "Employee Archive" (Transfer content default: "Y") before deleting that user.

> For every user, script makes 7 API calls to archive their content and delete the account.

**For detailed script overview, please follow [this guide](https://developer.box.com/guides/cli/scripts/deprovision-users/).**

## Setup Pre-Requisites
1. Clone this github repo or download files from the `/examples` directory
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/box/boxcli.git
   ```
2. Install PowerShell or .Net core.
   > If you encounter issues make sure you install both dotnet core and PowerShell
    1. For MacOS & Linux, Install the latest version of [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell?view=powershell-7.2).
    2. For Windows, Install the latest version of [dotnet core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).
    
3. Test PowerShell by running the `pwsh` command in your terminal.
   ```bash
   pwsh
   ```
   
	```
	mikechen@mbp create-users-automation % pwsh
	PowerShell 7.2.1
	Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation.
	
	https://aka.ms/powershell
	Type 'help' to get help.
	
	PS /Users/mikechen>
	```

4. Create an OAuth Application using the [CLI Setup Quick Start][oauth-guide].

## 1. Script Parameters
1. Update the [EmployeeList](Users_Deprovision.ps1#L12) to set your own Employee List CSV Path.
2. Customize the [input file of employee accounts for deletion](Employees_to_delete.csv) by providing their **email** addresses
	* For example, update the [Employees_to_delete.csv](Employees_to_delete.csv) with the following data:
	```
	name,email
	Managed User 1,ManagedUser1@test.com
	```
3. Optional: To skip transfer of user content before deletion, set [TransferContent](Users_Deprovision.ps1#L15) to "N".
4. Optional: Update Archive folder name by changing  [EmployeeArchiveFolderName](Users_Deprovision.ps1#L18) to any name of your choice.
5. Optional: Update the User ID which will be the new owner of the files, by changing [NewFilesOwnerID](Users_Deprovision.ps1#L10) or
set the flag `NewFilesOwnerID` when running the script:
`./Users_Deprovision.ps1 -NewFilesOwnerID 123456`. If no ID was provided, script will prompt to input in the interactive mode, or use the current authenticated user ID to receive the content.
6. Optional: To run the script in dry run mode, set the `DryRun` boolean flag when running the script:
`./Users_Deprovision.ps1 -DryRun`.
 Dry run doesn't mean that API calls won't be made, instead any create/update/delete calls will be skipped only.

## 2. Run the script
Change the directory to the folder containing the script. In this example, it is the `User Deprovisioning` folder.

```
rvb@lab:~/box-cli/examples/User Deprovisioning$ pwsh
PowerShell 7.2.4
Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation.

https://aka.ms/powershell
Type 'help' to get help.

PS /home/rvb/box-cli/examples/User Deprovisioning>
```

Run the script:
```bash
./Users_Deprovision.ps1
```


```
PS /home/rvb/box-cli/examples/User Creation & Provisioning> ./Users_Deprovision.ps1
Starting User Deprovisioning script...
```

Once script completes, you will see the following confirmation:

```
....
Transfered employee content Managed User 1 with User ID: 19927131476 to Employee Archive Folder
Deleted user 19927131476
Deleted employee Managed User 1
```

## Logging
Logs are stored in a `logs` folder located in the main folder. You have access to these log files:

* `Users_Deprovision_all.txt` that contains all log entries.
* `Users_Deprovision_errors.txt` that contains only errors.
