#APP SETUP
#README: This powershell script will use the Box CLI to build and create a user (admin or service account) owned "Onboarding" folder structure, create managed users in bulk, and provision the new users by collaborating them as viewer and uploaders into the newly created folder structure.

#APPLICATION ACCESS LEVEL (FOR JWT APPS): App + Enterprise Access
#APPLICATION SCOPES: Read & Write all folders stored in Box, Manage users, & Make API calls using the as-user header

#Onboarding Folder Structure: Set either path build off JSON or directly upload a local folder
